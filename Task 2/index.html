            <p id="detail-para"><strong> Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941)</strong> was the youngest son of Debendranath
                Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and
                which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads. He
                was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to England for formal schooling, he did not
                finish his studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities, he
                managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity and
                increased his interest in social reforms. He also started an experimental school at Shantiniketan where
                he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education. From time to time he participated in the Indian
                nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political
                father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in
                1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in
                India.</br></br>

                <strong>Tagore</strong> had early success as a writer in his native Bengal. With his translations of
                some of his poems he became rapidly known in the West. In fact his fame attained a luminous height,
                taking him across continents on lecture tours and tours of friendship. For the world he became the voice
                of India’s spiritual heritage; and for India, especially for Bengal, he became a great living
                institution.</br> </br>

                Although <strong>Tagore</strong> wrote successfully in all literary genres, he was first of all a poet.
                Among his fifty and odd volumes of poetry are Manasi (1890) [The Ideal One], Sonar Tari (1894) [The
                Golden Boat], Gitanjali (1910) [Song Offerings], Gitimalya (1914) [Wreath of Songs, and Balaka (1916)
                [The Flight of Cranes]. The English renderings of his poetry, which include The Gardener (1913),
                Fruit-Gathering (1916), and The Fugitive (1921), do not generally correspond to particular volumes in
                the original Bengali; and in spite of its title,<strong> Gitanjali: Song Offerings (1912)</strong>, the
                most acclaimed of them, contains poems from other works besides its namesake. Tagore’s major plays are
                Raja (1910) [The King of the Dark Chamber], Dakghar (1912) [The Post Office], Achalayatan (1912) [The
                Immovable], Muktadhara (1922) [The Waterfall], and Raktakaravi (1926) [Red Oleanders]. He is the author
                of several volumes of short stories and a number of novels, among them Gora (1910), Ghare-Baire (1916)
                [The Home and the World], and Yogayog (1929) [Crosscurrents]. Besides these, he wrote musical dramas,
                dance dramas, essays of all types, travel diaries, and two autobiographies, one in his middle years and
                the other shortly before his death in 1941. <strong>Tagore </strong> also left numerous drawings and
                paintings, and songs for which he wrote the music himself.
